# Painter's Ref Lab - Milestone 1 Closeout

## 1. Executive Summary

Milestone 1 prioritized protecting the working deterministic app, reducing regression risk, and improving maintainability through documentation and discipline rather than risky architectural changes. The result is a clearer, better-documented baseline without changing the app's painter-facing behavior.

## 2. What Was Successfully Completed

- Smoke test checklist created in [docs/m1-smoke-test.md](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/docs/m1-smoke-test.md).
- Reference screenshot baseline process created in [docs/m1-reference-screenshots.md](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/docs/m1-reference-screenshots.md) with placeholder storage in [docs/reference-screenshots/README.md](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/docs/reference-screenshots/README.md).
- Baseline tag procedure documented in [docs/m1-baseline-tag.md](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/docs/m1-baseline-tag.md).
- Milestone planning and execution discipline documented across the M1 docs, including issue ordering, build order, and no-go zones.
- Internal structure/documentation pass completed in [app.js](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/app.js) and summarized in [docs/m1-m106-notes.md](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/docs/m1-m106-notes.md).
- Stable single-script architecture retained after regressions during refactor attempts.
- Repository workflow improved through issue-scoped branches, smoke-before-merge discipline, and explicit rollback rules in the M1 planning docs.

## 3. What Was Attempted But Reverted

- M1-03 helper extraction
- M1-03A reduced tonal-helper extraction

Both efforts were rolled back after repeated browser regressions, especially around image loading. This made the hidden coupling in the current runtime more visible and confirmed that stronger validation is required before future modularization.

## 4. Current Stable Baseline

Painter's Ref Lab is currently a browser-based deterministic client-side tool built around:

- HTML, CSS, and a single [app.js](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/app.js) runtime
- existing export workflows
- current image-processing features intact
- PWA support and service worker caching
- manual browser smoke testing as the primary release safety check

Core painter-facing workflows remain intact, including image load, grid, focal crop studies, squint, outline, mirror, grayscale, notan, tonal masks, temperature studies, palette notes, and export sheets.

## 5. Known Constraints

- Large monolithic [app.js](/Users/ardhendupathak/Documents/GitHub/PaintersRef_v5.2/app.js)
- Hidden state/render coupling around composition choice, processed canvases, and render routing
- Service worker cache sensitivity during asset changes
- No automated browser regression suite
- Manual validation still required after structural changes

## 6. Lessons Learned

- Stability is more valuable than elegance when the app is already useful.
- Small scoped changes outperform ambitious refactors in this codebase.
- Documentation can create real leverage by making the current architecture legible.
- Refactoring needs stronger safety nets before it becomes a net positive.
- Repeated regressions are a signal to reduce scope, not push harder.

## 7. M2 Readiness Assessment

Overall M2 readiness: **8/10**

- Product readiness: high. The working deterministic tool is usable and stable enough to keep evolving.
- Architecture readiness: moderate. The app is understandable enough to support careful feature work, but not yet safe for aggressive internal restructuring.

## 8. Recommended M2 Priorities

1. Compare mode improvements
2. Saved presets or remembered settings
3. Export preview polish
4. Mobile/iPad UX refinements
5. AI sandbox planning as a clearly separate optional layer

## 9. Refactoring Re-entry Conditions

Future refactoring should only resume when one or more of the following are true:

- The regression checklist is routinely used before merges.
- Browser-level validation exists beyond syntax/static checks.
- A clearly isolated subsystem has been identified and documented.
- Refactor work can be split into very small reversible changes.

## 10. Formal Closeout Statement

Milestone 1 is considered complete and archived as the stable deterministic foundation for future Painter's Ref Lab development.
